# 🚀 PingWatch Roadmap

Completed work lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). This file tracks planned work only.

---

## 🔴 High Priority

**Backend**
- **Sensor Templates** — named sensor bundles ("Web Server", "Domain Controller") stored in `app_settings`; per-row template picker in the Subnet Discovery result grid and Auto-Discovery sensor policy; Auto-Discovery can consume templates once they exist

---

## ⚙️ Medium Priority

**Backend**
- **Further sample rollup** — hourly/daily buckets beyond the existing 5-min rollup for multi-year retention at minimal storage cost

**Integrations**
- **Teams First-Class Integration** — native adaptive-card dispatcher; include scheduled-report delivery (PDF + CSV sidecar) as a second delivery option on the schedule editor alongside email
- **Probe types to add** — `ldap` (bind test), `postgres` / `mysql` (connection test), `ntp` (time-sync check), `imap` / `pop3` (mailbox auth), `mssql` (connection test) — `smtp`, `ssh`, `sftp`, `radius` are shipped

**UI**
- **Session Management Widget** — view + revoke active sessions from a dashboard widget or user-menu entry

---

## 🎨 Low Priority

**UI**
- Compact mode
- Accessible contrast mode
- Spacing / alignment cleanup
- **Bulk sensor operations** — pause/resume/delete N sensors with checkboxes (device-level bulk shipped; sensor-level is its own feature)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `g d` → devices, `g e` → events, `/` → focus search
- **Favorites** — star a sensor; pinned at top of device card
- **IPv6 dashboards** — IPAM UI currently assumes IPv4

**Backend**
- **Distributed probes** — lightweight remote agent shipping results back to the central server. Lets a sensor be assigned to a probe in a different network (branch office, DR site, customer LAN) so the central server can monitor things it can't reach directly. Architecture sketch (pull-based, NAT/firewall friendly): new `probes` table + `sensors.probe_id` column; agent polls `GET /api/probe/work` for assignments and POSTs results back. Agent reuses [`monitoring/probes.py`](monitoring/probes.py) so probe types stay in lockstep. Effort estimate: ~2-3 weeks basic (schema + token auth + work queue + result ingestion + agent script + assignment UI), ~4-6 weeks production-grade (token rotation, mTLS, agent auto-update, version compat). Main tradeoffs: ~10s DOWN-detection lag vs poll interval (real-time would require WebSockets — bigger lift), and agent must bundle Python deps for cross-platform install.
- **HA / clustering** — active-passive with shared PostgreSQL
